\title{Calculate ancestor-based similarity between terms}
\usage{
calculateAncestorSim(tree, terms, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{An OntologyTree object}

\item{terms}{A character vector of term IDs or names, or a numeric vector of term indices}

\item{verbose}{Logical scalar indicating whether to print progress messages}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix containing similarity scores between term pairs
}
\description{
Calculates semantic similarity between terms based on their common ancestors.
}
\details{
For any two terms a and b, let Sa and Sb be their respective sets of ancestor terms 
(including the terms themselves). The similarity is calculated as:

similarity = |Sa ∩ Sb| / |Sa ∪ Sb|

where |X| denotes the size of set X.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Calculate ancestor-based similarity for specific terms
sim <- calculateAncestorSim(tree, c("GO:0008150", "GO:0003674"))

# Calculate similarity using term indices
sim <- calculateAncestorSim(tree, 1:10)
}
