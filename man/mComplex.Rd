\title{Mouse Protein Complex Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with multiple rows (one per subunit-complex combination) and 11 columns:
\describe{
  \item{ComplexName}{Character. Name of the protein complex.}
  \item{Functional_Complex_Group}{Character. The functional group classification of the complex.}
  \item{Root}{Character. Root classification identifier.}
  \item{FCG_assoc_GO_ID}{Character. GO identifiers associated with the functional complex group.}
  \item{ComplexID}{Character. Unique identifier for the complex.}
  \item{subunits_gene_name}{Character. Gene names of complex subunits.}
  \item{organism}{Character. Source organism (Mouse).}
  \item{functions_go_id}{Character. GO term identifiers describing complex functions.}
  \item{functions_go_name}{Character. Names of the GO terms.}
  \item{functions_go_ontology}{Character. GO domain (e.g., cellular_component).}
  \item{Ontology_type}{Character. Type of ontology (e.g., CC for Cellular Component).}
}

This dataset provides a comprehensive view of protein complexes and their functional annotations,
particularly useful for studying protein complex organization and function in mouse.

\source{
Compiled from protein complex databases and GO annotations.

mComplex
}
\description{
This dataset contains information about protein complexes in mouse, including their functional groups,
associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and component proteins. Each complex is described with multiple
attributes including complex name, functional grouping, GO annotations, and subunit information.
