\title{Human Protein Complex Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with multiple rows (one per subunit-complex-function combination) and 10 columns:
\describe{
  \item{ComplexName}{Character. Name of the protein complex.}
  \item{Functional_Complex_Group}{Character. The functional group classification of the complex.}
  \item{Root}{Character. Root classification identifier.}
  \item{FCG_assoc_GO_ID}{Character. GO identifiers associated with the functional complex group.}
  \item{ComplexID}{Character. Unique identifier for the complex.}
  \item{subunits_gene_name}{Character. Gene names of complex subunits.}
  \item{functions_go_id}{Character. GO term identifiers describing complex functions.}
  \item{functions_go_name}{Character. Names of the GO terms.}
  \item{functions_go_ontology}{Character. GO domain (e.g., molecular_function).}
  \item{Ontology_type}{Character. Type of ontology (e.g., MF for Molecular Function).}
}

This dataset is particularly useful for studying protein complex functions and their molecular
activities in human cells. It can be used for analyzing protein-protein interactions,
functional annotations, and complex organization.

\usage{
hComplex
}
\description{
This dataset contains information about protein complexes in human, including their functional
associations, component proteins, and Gene Ontology (GO) annotations. Each row represents
a subunit-complex-function combination, providing detailed molecular function annotations
for protein complexes.
