\title{Plot Ontology Tree Visualization}
\usage{
plotOntologyTree(tree, layout = c("tree"), focus_terms = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{An OntologyTree object containing:
\itemize{
  \item termNames: Character vector of term names/IDs
  \item childMap: List mapping parents to children
  \item edgeTypes: List of relationship types
}}

\item{layout}{Character string specifying the visualization layout:
\describe{
  \item{tree}{Traditional hierarchical dendrogram (default)}
  \item{circular}{Circular dendrogram arrangement}
}}

\item{focus_terms}{Character vector of term IDs/names to highlight in the
visualization. If NULL (default), the entire tree is plotted.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object containing:
\itemize{
  \item Edge links showing term relationships
  \item Node points representing terms
  \item Text labels for terms
  \item Appropriate theme settings
}
}
\description{
Creates a visualization of an OntologyTree object as either a hierarchical or
circular dendrogram using ggraph. The visualization includes nodes representing
terms and edges representing relationships between terms. Supports focused
visualization of specific terms and their relationships.
}
\details{
The visualization includes:
\itemize{
  \item Nodes representing ontology terms
  \item Edges showing hierarchical relationships
  \item Node labels with term names or IDs
  \item Optional focus on specific terms and their connections
}

The function uses ggraph for visualization and supports:
\itemize{
  \item Hierarchical tree layout
  \item Node repulsion for better label placement
  \item Edge styling for relationship visualization
  \item Interactive term highlighting
}
}
\section{Error Handling}{

The function includes checks for:
\itemize{
  \item Empty trees (no edges)
  \item Invalid focus terms
  \item Missing required tree components
}
}

\examples{
# Create a simple ontology tree
parents <- c("a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "c", "d")
children <- c("b", "c", "c", "d", "e", "e", "f")

# Define annotations for each term
annotation <- list(
    "a" = 1:3,
    "b" = 3:4,
    "c" = 5,
    "d" = 7,
    "e" = 4:7,
    "f" = 8
)

# Build and plot the tree
tre <- buildOntologyTree(
    parentTerms = parents,
    childTerms = children,
    annotations = annotation
)
plotOntologyTree(tre)

# Plot with circular layout
plotOntologyTree(tre, layout = "circular")

# Focus on specific terms
plotOntologyTree(tre, focus_terms = c("a", "b", "c"))
