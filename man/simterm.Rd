\usage{
simterm(
  tree,
  terms,
  method = c("term", "ic", "resnik", "faith", "rel", "simic", "gogo", "wang", "anc"),
  ic_method = c("universal", "annotation", "wang", "offspring"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{An OntologyTree object}

\item{terms}{A character vector of term IDs/names, or numeric indices}

\item{method}{Similarity method to use:
* "term": Term overlap based methods
* "ic": Universal information content
* "resnik": Resnik's information content
* "faith": FaITH similarity
* "rel": Relevance similarity
* "simic": SimIC similarity
* "gogo": GOGO similarity
* "wang": Wang's method
* "anc": Ancestor based similarity}

\item{ic_method}{For "faith","rel",and "simic" methods:
* "universal": Calculate universal-based Information Content
* "annotation": Calculate annotation-based Information Content
* "wang": Wang's Information Content
* "offspring": Calculate offspring-based Information Content}

\item{submethod}{For "term" method only:
* "kappa": Cohen's kappa
* "overlap": Overlap coefficient
* "jaccard": Jaccard similarity
* "dice": Dice coefficient}

\item{normType}{For Resnik similarity only:
* "unif": By log of max annotation count
* "max": By maximum IC value
* "sum": By maximum pairwise IC
* "none": No normalization}

\item{weights}{Named vector of weights for GOGO/Wang methods. 
Names must match relation types (e.g., "is_a", "part_of"), values < 1.}

\item{useIgraph}{Use igraph-based calculation (faster for large graphs)}

\item{useCache}{Use cached IC values when applicable}

\item{verbose}{Print progress messages}
}
\value{
A symmetric numeric matrix of similarity scores with row/column names
}
\description{
A unified interface for calculating semantic similarity between ontology terms using
various methods. Each method has its own characteristics and is suitable for
different scenarios.
}
\details{
Available methods include:

## Term Overlap Methods (method = "term")
* kappa: Cohen's kappa coefficient
* overlap: Overlap coefficient
* jaccard: Jaccard similarity coefficient
* dice: Dice coefficient

## Information Content Based Methods
* ic: Universal IC that only depends on the structure
* resnik: Resnik's method with multiple normalization options
* faith: FaITH similarity for sparse annotations
* rel: Relevance similarity with IC-based correction
* simic: SimIC similarity with improved correction

## Graph-based Methods
* gogo: GOGO method optimized for GO terms
* wang: Wang's method considering relation types
* anc: Simple ancestor-based Jaccard similarity
}

# Basic usage
sim <- simterm(tree, c("GO:0008150", "GO:0003674"), method = "ic")

# Term overlap similarity
sim <- simterm(tree, terms, method = "term", submethod = "kappa")

# Resnik with normalization
sim <- simterm(tree, terms, method = "resnik", normType = "max")

# Wang method with custom weights
weights <- c("is_a" = 0.8, "part_of" = 0.6)
sim <- simterm(tree, terms, method = "wang", weights = weights)

# GOGO method with basic calculation
sim <- simterm(tree, terms, method = "gogo", useIgraph = FALSE)
