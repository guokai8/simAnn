\description{
A unified interface for calculating semantic similarity between ontology terms using
various methods. Each method has its own characteristics and is suitable for
different scenarios.

\details{
Available methods include:

## Term Overlap Methods (method = "term")
* kappa: Cohen's kappa coefficient for measuring categorical agreement
* overlap: Overlap coefficient based on set intersection
* jaccard: Jaccard similarity coefficient for set comparison
* dice: Dice coefficient emphasizing common elements

## Information Content Based Methods
* ic: Universal IC that only depends on the structure
* resnik: Resnik's method with multiple normalization options
* lin: Lin's similarity method
* faith: FaITH similarity for sparse annotations
* rel: Relevance similarity with IC-based correction
* simic: SimIC similarity with improved correction

## Graph-based Methods
* gogo: GOGO method optimized for GO terms
* wang: Wang's method considering relation types
* anc: Simple ancestor-based Jaccard similarity
